# metaclasses, 101.  metaclass gets called to instantiate a class (creating a class instance).
# effectively, __metaclass__ controls how that class is converted from a definition, to an object, with the 
# object being used to create instances of that class.
# note python doesn't exactly have definitions, just executions, but analogy is close enough :P
