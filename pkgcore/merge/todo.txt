missing triggers:
implement INSTALL_MASK


- misc-functions.sh
 1) big ass scanelf block.
 2) install_mask (need to bind domain generation of triggers for it)
 3) preinst_mask (same thing, although that shouldn't wipe mangle the install image)
 4) sfperms (feature based), domain bound
 5) suid control.  same thing (see a pattern?)
 6) selinux labelling.  need to override the copies there imo, installing then slapping labels on sucks, although could mangle the image file and use a selinux aware copy

prepman:
 1) all of it.  the symlink rewriting might be fun...

prepinfo:
 1) no different then prepman.

prepstrip:
 1) splitdebug (transformation, fun one that one- maybe higher up, generate N pkgs instead)
 2) installsources


prepall: (calls prepman, prepinfo, and prepstrip which are seperated in this list)
 1) qa: bug 4111, gen_usr_ldscript shit for static files.
 2) qa: check for la/.a in /lib
 3) more scanelf idiocy- check for libs without sonames, no NEEDED info.

not automatically invoked-

prepalldocs:
 1) symlink/compression.  usual.

potential
preplib:
 1) we can generate this ourselves... figure out if ebuilds really should be doing it themselves (eapi bump for that most likely)

size check (is there enough space on the partitions for merging?)
revdep check.
