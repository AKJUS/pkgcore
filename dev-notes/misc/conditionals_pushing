need to classify restrictions as existance tests, either true/false.
if conditional
	if negate:
		request_disable
	else
		request_enable
		
how does negation fit into this long view?
specifically, rolling changes back?
all potential conditionals of a package/format are treated as lists; no straight booleans, beyond inserting a doffed element and 
falling back to len test (may be changed, although any format requiring a true boolean conditional need implement some trickery)
