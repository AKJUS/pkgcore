hard to list everything mind you, but here is changes re: behaviour

* proper env saving/reloading.  Ebuild is sourced once, and ran from the env.
* DISTDIR has indirection now.  points at a directory, that is symlinks to the files.
  why?  This prevents builds from lieing about their sources (less bugs)
* PORTAGE_TMPDIR is no longer in the ebuild env
* (PORTAGE_|)BUILDDIR is no longer in the ebuild env
* BUILDPREFIX is no longer in the ebuild env
* AA is no longer in the ebuild env
* inherit is an error in phases except for setup, prerm, and postrm.
  pre/post rm are allowed only to deal with broken envs.  Running config with a broken env
  isn't allowed, cause config won't work; installing with a broken env, not allowed cause 
  preinst/postinst won't be executed.
