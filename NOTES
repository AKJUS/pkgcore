Release Notes:

  See ChangeLog for full commit logs.

pkgcore 0.1: 

  Initial release.
  
  * Sync functionality doesn't yet exist (pmaint script will be in 0.2)
  
  * pmerge vdb modification requires --force; this will be disabled in 0.2, 
    mainly is in place so that folks who are just looking, don't inadvertantly
    trigger an actual modification.
  
  * not all portage FEATURES are implemented; same for QA.
  
  * If overlays are in use, pkgcore may defer to it's a seperate cache to avoid 
    pkgcore causing cache regen for portage (and vice versa); this occurs due
    to pkgcore treating overlays as their own repo and combining them at a 
    higher level; portage smushes them all together thus rendering each subtree
    unusable in any standalone fashion.

  * pkgcore is far more anal about blocking bad behaviour in ebuilds during
    metadata regeneration; tree is clean, but if you do something wrong in 
    global scope, it *will* catch it and block it.
  
  * EBD; daemonized ebuild.sh processing (effectively), pkgcore reuses old
    ebuild.sh processes to avoid bash startup, speeding regen up by roughly
    2x.
